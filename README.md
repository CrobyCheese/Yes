# mc-classic-improved
A fork of the classic.minecraft.net game. I changed the following things:

- Electron application
- Tweaked menus
- Good mouse controls
- Custom main menu
- Remapped default settings
- Fixed sounds not playing when placing blocks
- Credits screen
- Custom world-gen
- Custom commands (/say, /tele, /seed)
- No grass spread on player placed blocks
- Correctly pitched bush sounds
- All items are obtainable
- Inproved movement
- Simple fying mode (made by a mod developer at <http://mod.heathmitchell1.repl.co/>)

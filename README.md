# mc-classic-improved
A fork of the classic.minecraft.net game. I changed the following things:

- Made a electron application
- Tweaked menus
- Good mouse controls
- Custom main menu
- Remapped default settings
- Fixed sounds not playing when placing blocks
- Credits screen
- Custom world-gen
- Custom commands (/say, /tele, /seed)
- No grass spread on player placed blocks
- Correctly pitched bush sounds
- All items are obtainable

I used some code from [RealTheSunCat](https://github.com/RealTheSunCat/Minecraft-Classic-Reversed), who documented large parts of the code.  
I also used some code from Alawnely, who has [this great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFom-RNcLps&t=586s) about modding js0.23.

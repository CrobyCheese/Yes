This project aims to improve upon js0.23 ([classic.minecraft.net](https://classic.minecraft.net)) by adding features to make it closer to the original, or just stuff I like myself.

- Electron application
- Tweaked menus
- Good mouse controls
- Custom main menu
- Custom default settings
- Fixed sounds not playing when placing blocks (this wasn't in the original, but I also don't like it in the original)
- Hidden credits screen
- Custom commands (/say, /tele, /seed)
- No grass spread on player placed blocks
- Better pitched bush sounds (but I also like the low sound, so it's a bit lower then the original)
- All items are obtainable
- Somewhat improved movement
- Simple fying mode (made by a mod developer at <http://mod.heathmitchell1.repl.co/>)

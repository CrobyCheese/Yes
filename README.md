# mc-classic-improved
A fork of the classic.minecraft.net game. I changed the following things:

- Made a electron application
- Tweaked menus
- Good mouse controls
- Custom main menu
- Remapped default settings
- Fixed sounds not playing when placing blocks
- Credits screen
- Custom world-gen

I used some code from [RealTheSunCat](https://github.com/RealTheSunCat/Minecraft-Classic-Reversed), who documented large parts of the code.
